## Goal
MrHazel aims to be a lightweight, single user 'micro'-blog.  Think Twitter, but for people without friends.

## License

I'm going to go with the self-coined IDGAF License.  That means, do whatever you want with it.  This is hardly a new concept, just a project to stay fresh and use some PHP5.4 features.
